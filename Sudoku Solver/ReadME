      In our project we propose a method of detecting and recognizing the elements of a Sudoku Puzzle and providing the solution for it . The method involves a vision-based sudoku solver. The solver is capable of solving a sudoku
directly from an image captured from any digital camera. After applying appropriate pre-processing to the acquired image we use efficient area calculation techniques to recognize the enclosing box of the puzzle. A virtual grid is then created to identify the digit positions.OCR(optical character recognition engine is used as a method for digit recognition. The actual solution is computed using a backtracking algorithm. Experiments conducted on various types of sudoku questions demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed approaches in real-world scenarios.
